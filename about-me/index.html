			<h1 class="center">about me</h1>
	
</header>
<p>I grew up in Westchester, NY, went to school at UC Berkeley, lived in Vancouver, Canada, Florence, Italy, and finally settled in Boulder, CO. I am a software engineer by day and a health nutjob by night. I meditate, lift weights, run, hike, and fill the gaps in my day by cooking. I enjoy long walks to Whole Foods and sunbathing. I have been following a strict elimination diet since March of 2013 and have developed tools I believe to be essential to success. I have utilized these tools to maintain a symptom-free lifestyle through university, full time work, travel, moving, living abroad, and stress. I want to share my findings with others and find community in those taking a similar path</p>

<h1>You</h1>

<p>You are sick. You believe diet might help and maybe even have heard of the <a href="http://eatinghorror.com/blog/2014/03/05/why-aip/">autoimmune protocol</a>. Maybe you want to meet others who feel the same way. Maybe you want recipes or tips on how to ease the stress and isolation choosing this lifestype can bring. I can provide you the support, tips, and help you need to succeed.</p>

<h1>Why</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m 21 years young. Over the last seven years, I&rsquo;ve collected a few autoimmune diseases &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis">arthritis</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">depression</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, and most recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease">crohn&rsquo;s disease</a>. I used to pity myself and pray for my medication to work. When I was finally face to face with a life in and out of hospitals, iron transfusions, surgeries and more, I took control of my life. I ate oily fish, drank daily bone broths, and consumed a wide variety of vegetables. I ate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076YG8AE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0076YG8AE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eatihorr-20">seaweed</a> and grass fed meats, limited fruits, slept 9-10 hours a night, and exercised regularly, all while earning a four-year Computer Science degree in three years. I was not perfect, but I saw drastic improvement in my condition.</p>

<p>Since then, I see disease everywhere I look &mdash; pill bottles, diarrhea, rancid farts, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis">gut dysbiosis</a>, autoimmune diseases, cancer and otherwise. I see people eating non-foods, prioritizing work over their lives, avoiding the outdoors, immobilized by the comforts of modern society. Disease is not the norm &mdash; humans were meant to be healthy. I want to help correct our notion of what disease is and how we treat it.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>

<p>Since starting my elimination diet, I have obliterated nearly every sign of my autoimmune diseases. My intestinal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula">fistula</a>, scarring and inflammation is healed, my <a href="http://www.crohnsforum.com/wiki/Stricture">stricture</a> is small enough to be invisible on an MRI, my depression has subsided, psoriasis gone. Some claim to not have results like this when trying to use diet to treat autoimmune diseases. I have found by talking with them that they were either not 100% compliant or did not give the diet enough time. I realize how hard it is to maintain, but I promise it is worth it.</p>

<h1>Long Term</h1>

<p>I would be lying if I told you I am as diligent now as I was when I started. I am not, which is a good thing. After one year of compliance, my body is much more able to tolerate random foods that I throw at it. I don&rsquo;t do food reintroductions. I believe everything I eliminated was hurting my body and should not be a part of my daily diet. I do treat myself to dried mango, occasional chocolate, even rice that one time, with only minor intestinal disturbance. The most important part is consistently eating nutrient dense foods. The important takeaway is that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. No, you will never eat gluten again (I did once by mistake and it triggered a flare), but you can eat (more) normal, I promise.</p>
