Apparently Whole Foods just gives fish heads away! That means I'm making stock tonight. Here's how:

<!-- more -->

This is extraordinarily easy to make and very healthy. Fish provide iodine -- an important nutrient that other foods permitted on the autoimmune protocol lack, making fish stock an essential staple. Iodine is an important element in regulating thyroid activity. Fish stock also provides all of the same benefits that beef stock provides.

I'm going to use my 6-quart [slow cooker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P2NG0K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004P2NG0K&linkCode=as2&tag=eatihorr-20) to do most of the heavy lifting. Before we get started, you'll need

- 2 fish heads and carcasses
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3-4 carrots, chopped
- acid (lemon, [ACV](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I7MVG0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001I7MVG0&linkCode=as2&tag=eatihorr-20), or other)
- filtered water
- salt

Now, all you have to do it throw everything into your favorite slow cooker and turn it on low. After about 6-7 hours, you will have extracted all of the fishy goodness. Next, pour the stock through a fine strainer or sieve into containers for storage. I suggest refrigerating some and freezing some for later. About 1-2 cups per day is plenty (depending on if you're currently in a flare). 

Happy fishing!
