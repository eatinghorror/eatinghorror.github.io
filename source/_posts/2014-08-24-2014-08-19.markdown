## Food

I ate sparingly to try to avoid symptoms, but it did include

* roasted broccoli, chicken and sweet potato
* steak w/ acorn squash

## Symptoms

* ~15 BMs throughout the day, all of which were equally horrible
* intermittent severe stomach pain, blinding at times

## Extra

Did blood work at the doctor today and got CBC results -- I am not anemic! This result tells me that most of the damage was done more recently and for the most part my body has been absorbing important nutrients.
