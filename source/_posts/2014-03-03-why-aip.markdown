I'm not going to bore you with details. If you want the nitty gritty, scientific response to drop on your friends and family when they give you quizzical looks, please refer to [Paleo Mom](http://www.thepaleomom.com/category/autoimmune-2/the-whys-of-the-aip) for the authoritative source. 

Now, before we talk any further we have to establish that a [leaky gut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_permeability) is a necessary precursor to any autoimmune disease. Luckily, scientists have begun researching exactly that. One group of scientists found that "increased intenstinal permeability... is observed prior to disease and appears to be involved in disease pathogenesis"<sup>1</sup>. Another concluded thatwhen the intercellular junctions are deregulated, autommimmune diseases can occur<sup>2</sup>. There is mounting evidence that leaky gut precedes all autoimmune diseases, and, more importantly, that autoimmune disease cannot happen if a leaky gut is not present. Therefore, helping our bodies fix our intestinal linings should help cure autoimmune disease<sup>3</sup>

There are several main ways we can help our bodies repair themselves. We can reduce foods that irritate the gut, increase foods that are nutrient dense (help repair the gut), and reduce stress. 

Now, there is an incredibly long list of foods that irritate the gut -- don't be alarmed. Some of these foods you might be able to introduce back into your diet after disease stabilizes. This list includes eggs, nuts, seeds, nightshades, alcohol, [gluten cross-reactive foods](http://www.thepaleomom.com/2013/03/gluten-cross-reactivity-update-how-your-body-can-still-think-youre-eating-gluten-even-after-giving-it-up.html), excessive fructose, as well as grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, vegetable oils, or any processed foods/chemical/nitrates/etc. Minimizing these foods will give your body a much needed break from fighting itself to give it a chance for healing. 

In order to heal, we want to give our body nutrient dense food. My personal favorite is beef liver. I literally feel happier just by eating beef liver. Usually, I eat liver (or other organ meats) about four times a week, or about 1lb a week. Some people don't like the taste and some will tell you to freeze it and take it like a pill. I disagree<sup>4</sup>. I used to dislike the taste of beef liver, I'll admit it, but it grew on me with passion. Now I look forward to my liver days, and often crave it on days that I don't get to eat any. The act of eating it brightens my day, a result I don't would occur if taken in pill form. Another important food to include is fish and shellfish (for DHA and EPA omega 3's), preferably wild. Then of course vegetables -- green at every meal, colors elsewhere, eat the rainbow, etc. etc. We also want quality, grass fed, pasture raised meats. Similarly, quality fats, coming from quality meats or use olive oil, coconut oil, or avocado oil. 

Stress reduction is probably the hardest to nail down and give general guidelines, which coincidentally makes it the hardest for those following the AIP protocol to really follow. I enjoy meditation to help manage my stress and always ensure I get at least 9 hours of sleep (sometimes I need more). Those with autoimmune disease tend to need more sleep than others. Feeling tired throughout the day is not normal -- get more sleep.

I know this is a large list. I know this seems impossible. It isn't. My goal is to provide you with the tools necessary to transform your life and gain some sense of control over whatever plagues you.

I am 21 years old -- I have followed the autoimmune protocol in college, while working full time, living in Italy, vacationing, and through personal crises. It is possible -- [follow me](https://twitter.com/EatingHorror) on twitter to find out.

(4) I have no medical reason to disagree -- you can feel free to pop frozen liver pills of that sounds good to you.
