Time is precious. We don't have time to carefully craft every dish, nor should we strive to. Yes, we should take pleasure in cooking and most importantly eating, but sometimes there is no time for that. The number one response I hear when I out myself is "I don't have time to eat like that." I hear it from those with autoimmune diseases, coworkers, friends and family. Well -- I'm sorry, but you do have time to eat like me, and here's how.

## Cook in bulk

Ok, this one isn't a secret. I cook as if I were feeding a family of 5... always. If I'm cooking something and it isn't going to feed me for at least 3 meals (some exceptions exist, I'll get to them), I won't cook it. I cannot possibly live my life if I have to cook more than once a day (I usually cook less than once a day). I tend to cook nights and then eat that for dinner, breakfast, lunch and possibly more if it lasts. I like to carve out at least 3 nights a week that I don't have to cook. I almost always have food in my fridge to eat so I can take these nights more flexibly. Having plentiful food also makes it orders of magnitude easier to stay compliant.

## Find a restaurant

Yes, I am encouraging you to eat out. But -- I want you to have a conversation with the restaurant. Where I live, there is a restaurant [zeal](http://zealfood.com/) that serves a bowl with cauliflower rice, roasted veggies (nightshade free), and pasture raised beef. I went over all of the ingredients with them and feel completely comfortable eating there. Now, I don't go there all the time, but I do go about once a week to relax and feel normal. Additionally, it provides a nice backup in case I want to go out one night I don't have to worry about having enough food in the fridge -- I can always just go to my preapproved restaurant.

## Cook meat and vegetables separately

It might make meals less exciting, but cooking vegetables and meat separately is an enormous time saver. You can quickly sautee or roast veggies while slow cooking meat. Separately cooking them tends to result in less prep time because it forces you to make simpler meals. Additionally, now your vegetable supplies and meat supplies can vary independently -- you can tune ratios, cook more of one without more of the other, and generally makes cooking faster and eating easier. 

## Food is fuel

Remember that food is merely the raw input to your body. Keeping this in mind can help change how you approach cooking and eating and help you prioritize other aspects of your life. It can be hard to remember that food doesn't have to be *amazing* while drooling over the AIP blogs. In times of need, taste can be sacrificed. When I'm in a hurry, I don't brown meat before slow cooking it, or sautee minced veggies before throwing them into a meatloaf. It makes my life easier and I don't mind the taste. I call it functional eating.

## Throw away meals

I have go to meals I make when I want to produce vast quantities of food in small chunks of time. I make meatloaf nearly every week (recipe pending). I can make 6 meals worth of food in about 20 minutes of prep time, 1 hour in the oven. I can throw a roast in the slow cooker in about 5 minutes. I can have broccoli roasted in 40 minutes, kale sauteed in 15, fish broiled in 12, liver and onions in 20. These are my quick meals -- when I don't want to cook.

## Special Meals

The above only works when you balance the equation with special meals. Meals that you go out of your way to make delicious -- better than you or any of your friends have ever had. Special meals trick myself into cleaning my kitchen and remind myself that I really do enjoy cooking. Special meals remind myself that AIP is not restrictive and I can find pleasure in compliant foods. Special meals are what you find on blogs and in recipe books. My favorite is ginger garlic scallion crusted salmon (recipe pending). No one tells you how to make throw away meals though, so I will. Stay tuned.
