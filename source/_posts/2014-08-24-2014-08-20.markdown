## Food

I didn't keep track of food intake. It included a green juice, meat, and sweet potato. I stopped eating vegetables to see if that would help symptoms improve

## Symptoms

* ~10 BMs
* intermittent, severe intestinal pain
* I could actually feel food move through my colon... a somewhat new and bizarre experience for me
