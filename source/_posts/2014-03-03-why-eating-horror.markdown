Partly as a homage to [codinghorror](http://blog.codinghorror.com) -- I'm a developer by day -- but mostly because I now look back on my old eating habits with horror. Let me back up.

In August of 2006 I was diagnosed with [ankylosing spondylitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis) (arthritis). The doctors initially thought I broke my toe until my other foot ballooned days later. In 2008, I developed psoriosis, a minor annoyance. In January of 2013 I was diagnosed with Crohns Disease (CD). I was actually diagnosed with severe CD -- I had a [fistula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula) in my colon and a [stricture](http://www.crohnsforum.com/wiki/Stricture) -- severe enough for me to go on [mesalamin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesalazine) and [Humira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humira) (you may have seen it on TV). That's three autoimmune diseases before the age of 21.

Since then, I have taken to an elimination diet (AIP paleo) popularized by [Paleo Mom](http://www.thepaleomom.com/), and I haven't looked back since -- well, only a few times. It is nearly one year later and I can say that all of my diseases are improved and I am gearing up to go off of my medication.

This blog is only tangentially about me though -- mostly how my experiences can help you and draw connections between your experiences and mine. Really, the goal of this blog is to find and give support for those trying to give their bodies the necessary materials to heal themselves au natural. I hope to provide tips and strategies to help people be compliant in their day to day lives, help them regain control when we cheat (it's inevitable), and motivate.
