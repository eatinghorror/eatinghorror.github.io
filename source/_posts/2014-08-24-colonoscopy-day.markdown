Results were less favorable than I wanted, but on par for what I expected. I had been cheating frequently in June and July and it seems the coffee and chocolate had caught up to me. I wasn't anticipating great results.

<!-- more -->

* Severe Swelling in rectum
* Inflammation and moderate activity in the transverse colon
* stricture in the ascending colon (old news, this is predominantly scar tissue and won't likely improve)

My doctor recommended that I go back on Humira, but I decided to give myself 2-3 months of strict compliance, keep a journal, and use qualitative measurements as well as an MRI at the end of the time to reevaluate my situation and decide if medication is necessary.

Today marks the first day of my journey, treating severe Crohns without anti-inflammatories or immunosuppresants.

I'll be publicly sharing all the foods that I eat and everything that leaves my body. You can follow that action on the [journal](/journal) page of my blog. I'll also be giving larger updates on the home page.
